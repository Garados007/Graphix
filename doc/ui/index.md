# UI Language Definition

The UI is written in plain XML and loaded when the game starts.

A very minimalistic example is this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<Objects>

</Objects>
```

In the section of `<Objects>` are all Definitions.

**Topics:**

- [Import of other files](import.md)
- [Definition of Status](status.md)
- [Definition of Prototypes](prototype.md)
- [Variables and Parameter](variables.md)
- [Animations](animation.md)





A small demonstration you can find here: [Graphix.DemoApp/ui/demo.xml](../../Graphix.DemoApp/ui/demo.xml).
